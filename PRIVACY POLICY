# Privacy Policy for Replit Trader App

**Effective Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Owner:** Brittany Terrell

This Privacy Policy explains how Replit Trader (“the App”) handles your information.

---

## 1. What Information Is Collected?

The App **does not collect** personal data, user behavior data, or financial data directly.  
Any data used or stored is handled by the **third-party broker (Alpaca)** which you connect via API keys.

---

## 2. Third-Party APIs

Replit Trader uses:
- **Alpaca API** – to execute stock trades
- **Render** – to host backend logic
- **Glide** – to power the mobile interface

Each of these services has their own privacy policies. You are responsible for reviewing and managing your accounts with those services.

---

## 3. API Credentials

Your API keys are stored securely via environment variables on the backend (not within the app). You are responsible for not sharing them with unauthorized users.

---

## 4. Security

We follow best practices to prevent unauthorized access to your backend logic. However, no system is 100% secure. You use this app at your own risk.

---

## 5. Data Retention

We do not retain user data. Any trading history is managed by Alpaca and governed by their retention policies.

---

## 6. Updates to This Policy

We may revise this policy in the future. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated terms.
